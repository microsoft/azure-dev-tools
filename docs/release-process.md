# Canvas release process

Canvas packages in this repository are published only after the candidate has
been reviewed and approved. A release must preserve both reproducible package
bytes and a stable customer installation path.

## Release tags

Each product uses two tag forms:

- `PRODUCT-latest` is movable. Update it only after the approved candidate PR
  merges. It must point to the same merge commit as the new immutable tag.
- `PRODUCT-v<semver>-<source-sha>` is immutable. The repository's current tag
  convention writes semantic-version separators as hyphens, for example
  `PRODUCT-v1-2-3-abcdef0`. Never move, delete, or recreate an immutable tag.

A package version identifies one exact set of bytes. Once a version has been
used for a public candidate or release, different bytes require a new version,
even when the change is described as a rebuild or correction. The source SHA in
the immutable tag records the reviewed source revision; it does not permit the
same version to be reused for different output.

When one approved production PR contains multiple independently reviewed products,
their distinct source-qualified immutable version tags may all point to that
same PR's merge commit. Verify each product's source revision, version, and
package bytes separately; do not create the tags before the PR merges.
For a separately reviewed skill-only product stacked on that PR, its immutable
tag instead points to its own later approved merge commit. A marketplace
verifier must check that the earlier product release is an ancestor, that
the skill-only package tree and full checksum inventory match its tag, and
that it has no extension or canvas. Its package root may be `plugins/<product>`
with `plugin.json` directly in that directory rather than the canvas layout.

Release order:

1. Start with content cleared for public distribution in this repository.
2. Run the package's required tests and release checks.
3. Produce an inventory of the package files and record their SHA-256 digests
   in `SHA256SUMS`.
4. Obtain explicit approval for the candidate and its customer-facing
   materials in this repository.
5. Merge the approved candidate PR.
6. Create the immutable `PRODUCT-v<semver>-<source-sha>` tag at the merge
   commit.
7. Verify the immutable install URL and README, then move `PRODUCT-latest` to
   that same merge commit.
8. Verify the latest install URL and README before sending the announcement.
9. Pin the released package in the Awesome Copilot catalog, when applicable.

Never move `PRODUCT-latest` to an unmerged branch, candidate commit, or
unapproved rebuild.

The canvas package directories in this repository retain the reviewed public
distribution bytes, including customer README links to the public source.
Production installation links and tag verification use
`microsoft/azure-dev-tools`; keep channel-specific guidance outside those
frozen canvas directories. Disclose and checksum any separately reviewed
skill-only product documentation overlays in its own release PR.

## Customer README verification

Release verification must fail closed if a package export replaces a
customer-facing README with internal packaging, build, or provider prose.
For an extension-bearing canvas, before approval and again after tagging,
verify that the README:

- starts with the customer value statement;
- includes an `## Install` section with the
  `PRODUCT-latest/canvases/PRODUCT/extensions/EXTENSION` nested-folder URL;
- links to the README through `PRODUCT-latest`;
- includes the exact prompt needed to open the canvas;
- includes a numbered quickstart using actual UI labels; and
- retains applicable prerequisites, troubleshooting, and safety guidance.

An export may update the README only when the release PR explicitly presents
the customer-facing change for review. Missing sections, a wrapper-directory
install URL, a branch URL, or packaging-only prose blocks the release.
For a skill-only companion, use its approved skill-only install instructions,
native host-skill prerequisite, and runnable toolkit compatibility gate
instead of inventing an extension URL.

## Production release PR communication

Write the title for a customer, not a release ledger: start with the specific
problem and name the fix, for example
`Fix <specific customer blocker> with <Product> <version>`, rather than
`Release <Product>`. Put these two parts in the PR body, in this order:

1. **Customer change:** State the concrete problem, how this release fixes it,
   what a user can now do, and what remains unavailable or not yet enabled.
   Lead with the outcome, not build provenance or approval boilerplate.
2. **Release facts and handoff:** Keep a short, labeled list of the source
   revision (full SHA and a commit link if public), the *separate reviewed
   public package* commit and artifact link, version, and a link to `SHA256SUMS` with
   the relevant file's SHA-256 digest. Link the nested-folder install URL and
   customer README at the production candidate commit; label them **candidate**,
   not **latest**. After promotion, add the verified immutable-version and
   `PRODUCT-latest` URLs. Record commands/checks actually run and their results;
   mark unrun checks as **not run** with a reason and owner. Name only specific
   remaining risks or blockers, plus the next owner and action.

If the candidate changes, refresh its links, digests, and check results. Do not
claim approvals, latest availability, signing, or installer verification that
have not happened, or list unrelated risks and repeated generic gate language.
This PR-writing guidance does not replace the release order, verification, or
two-bullet announcement requirements.

## Copy/paste team announcement

Every release PR must include a ready-to-send announcement with exactly two
bullets. Replace every placeholder; do not hard-code this template to a future
version.

- **`<Product> <version>`:** `<short customer value and rollout statement>`.
  **Rollout owner:** `<person or team>`. **Dark-deployed:** `<status and scope,
  when applicable>`.
- **Install:** latest
  `<https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/<product>-latest/canvases/<product>/extensions/<extension>>`;
  README
  `<https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/blob/<product>-latest/canvases/<product>/README.md>`;
  exact version
  `<https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/<product>-v<major>-<minor>-<patch>-<source-sha>/canvases/<product>/extensions/<extension>>`.

The first bullet must name the product and version, explain the value or rollout
in one short statement, and use the literal wording **Rollout owner:**. Include
the **Dark-deployed:** field when the release is available before broad
announcement or enablement. The second bullet must contain paste-ready latest,
README, and immutable source-qualified URLs.

## Governance

`SHA256SUMS` records file integrity digests. It is not a signature, does not
imply a signing mechanism, and does not claim installer verification.

Each release must also complete applicable security, legal, licensing,
third-party-notice, and open-source readiness reviews. The package exports
include their reviewed third-party notices; do not replace them without a new
release review.
