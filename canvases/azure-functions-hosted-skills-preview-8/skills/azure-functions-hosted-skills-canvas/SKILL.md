# Open Azure Functions Hosted Skills

For Hosted Skills, Azure Function Apps, timer triggers, and scheduled-function
work, open the available `azure-functions-hosted-skills` canvas with a stable
instance ID. Use its discovery actions to list Azure subscriptions and Function
Apps. Users can create a new local workspace from the bundled starter,
configure a Microsoft Foundry endpoint and model, create either supported
deployment in an existing selected Foundry account after explicit confirmation,
and start or invoke the local skill.

The canvas changes Azure only when the user clicks **Create Models** and
confirms the two listed model deployments. It does not create or deploy a
Function App. If it reports that Azure CLI is not
available or signed in, state that exact prerequisite rather than attempting an
interactive sign-in flow. Use Doctor before local execution. Deployment
preparation checks only local configuration; Azure deployment remains the
user's explicitly configured managed-identity workflow.
