# Azure Functions Hosted Skills

Build and run Hosted Skills in a local Azure Function App, or select an
existing Azure Function App and invoke a supported deployed function.

## Install

**Install the full plugin.** When the production `microsoft/azure-dev-tools`
marketplace lists version 0.5.2, use GitHub Copilot **Customize → Plugins →
marketplace gear → add `microsoft/azure-dev-tools` (ID `azure-dev-tools`) →
install Azure Functions Hosted Skills**. This includes the canvas and both
launcher skills. After installation, fully quit and reopen GitHub Copilot,
start a fresh chat, and confirm `azure-functions-hosted-skills-canvas` and
`azure-functions-hosted-skills-github-daily-digest` are available.

After marketplace publication, the CLI equivalent is:

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install azure-functions-hosted-skills@azure-dev-tools
```

If the marketplace is not listed yet, an optional full-plugin CLI fallback
uses the exact immutable 0.5.2 versioned/source-qualified tag supplied with
the release. Set `HOSTED_SKILLS_TAG` to that published
`azure-functions-hosted-skills-v0-5-2-<source-qualifier>` tag first:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch "$HOSTED_SKILLS_TAG" https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools.git azure-functions-hosted-skills-plugin
copilot plugin install ./azure-functions-hosted-skills-plugin/canvases/azure-functions-hosted-skills
```

The marketplace follows production main rather than an immutable source tag.

> **Canvas-only fallback:** If the full plugin is unavailable, use
> **Customize → Canvases → Install from gist/URL** with the nested
> `https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/tree/azure-functions-hosted-skills-latest/canvases/azure-functions-hosted-skills/extensions/azure-functions-hosted-skills`
> URL. The `-latest` tag is movable. This canvas-only installation does not
> install the routing and daily-digest launcher skills; new apps still receive
> the required `.funcignore` exclusions and unsafe deployment is refused.

See the
[Azure Functions Hosted Skills README](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-dev-tools/blob/azure-functions-hosted-skills-latest/canvases/azure-functions-hosted-skills/README.md)
for this quickstart and safety guidance.

Then ask:

```text
Open Azure Functions Hosted Skills canvas
```

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub Copilot environment that supports installing and opening canvas
  extensions.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  installed and authenticated with `az login`.
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
  and Node.js.
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) signed in for the bundled repository-digest example.
- `uv` (preferred) or Python 3.13 or later. When `uv` is available, the canvas
  can provision the required Python version for the generated app.
- Azurite for the first local run.
- A compatible model in the current GitHub Copilot session, or access to an
  existing Microsoft Foundry deployment or governed Azure AI Gateway model.

Open **Doctor → Run Doctor** for a read-only check of the required tools,
Python package access, Azure CLI sign-in, and extension registration. Azure
Developer CLI (`azd`) is optional unless you choose **Create Models** or
**Deploy to Azure**.

## First local run

1. Select **Local Function App**. The canvas creates the bundled starter in
   `functions/daily-repo-digest` in the current worktree; use **Change** before
   creation to choose another subfolder.
2. In **Parameters JSON object**, keep
   `{"repository":"Azure/azure-functions-host"}` or replace it with an
   `owner/repo` value or GitHub repository URL.
3. Under **MODEL ENDPOINT**, keep the default **GitHub Copilot** provider and
   review the selected model. The canvas prefers GPT-5 mini when that model is
   available in the current session; otherwise it uses the first compatible
   model in the host-provided catalog. Choose **Microsoft Foundry** or
   **Azure AI Gateway** only when you want an Azure-backed model; those
   providers then require an Azure subscription.
4. Select **Start local function**. The canvas prepares an isolated Python
   environment, installs the app dependencies, starts Azurite when needed, and
   starts the local Functions host.
5. Select **Timer**, review the skill instructions, and select
   **Invoke Trigger**.
6. Review **Agent digest**, **Trigger activity**, **Commands**, and the
   **Local function host log**.

Switching Timer, HTTP, and Queue only changes the selected view; it does not
rewrite the generated app or restart the local host. A new Queue skill is
created when you save its instructions, open it in VS Code, start the host, or
invoke it. Existing apps do not synthesize missing skills. An invalid Queue
test-input draft stays in the editor when you switch away and back; correct it
before invoking.

You can also use **Open existing app…** for a local folder that contains
`host.json` and at least one valid `.agent.md` file. Local Queue invocation
writes only to Azurite. Microsoft 365 Inbox invocation uses representative
dry-run data and does not call Outlook locally.

## Invoke an existing Azure Function App

1. Select **Azure Function App**.
2. Choose the Azure subscription and Function App.
3. Select a discovered function. The canvas identifies whether its HTTP,
   Timer, or Storage Queue trigger has a supported invocation contract.
4. Enter optional test input and select **Invoke**.

Remote invocation sends a real request or queue message to the selected Azure
resource. Unsupported trigger types remain unavailable rather than being
guessed. Remote response capture is not guaranteed; use the bounded trigger
activity and Application Insights views to confirm the result.

## Example prompts

```text
Open Azure Functions Hosted Skills canvas
```

```text
Build a daily GitHub repository digest as a local Hosted Skill.
```

```text
Use my existing Foundry model, start the local Timer skill, and invoke it.
```

```text
Select an existing Azure Function App and help me test a supported function.
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the canvas is missing after installation, fully quit and reopen GitHub
  Copilot, start a fresh project chat, and retry the exact open prompt.
- For the App install, use the nested `extensions/azure-functions-hosted-skills`
  URL, not the plugin directory.
- Run **Doctor** and follow its specific fixes for PATH, Python, Core Tools,
  Node.js, Azurite, Azure CLI sign-in, package-index access, or duplicate
  installations.
- If Azure resources or models are absent, verify `az account show`, the
  selected subscription, and your read/invoke permissions, then refresh.
- Do not install a second provider to work around a stale registration. Disable
  retired or duplicate registrations through GitHub Copilot, preserve generated
  apps and state, reinstall the canonical extension, and restart the app.

## Safety and authentication

- The extension uses your Azure CLI identity and never signs in for you.
- **Doctor** is read-only and never installs software or changes Azure.
- **Create Models** and **Deploy to Azure** create or change real Azure
  resources and require an explicit action in the canvas.
- **Invoke** can execute a local trigger or send real traffic to the selected
  Azure Function App. Review the target and input before invoking.
- Load testing sends throttled real HTTP traffic. It does not create, modify,
  scale, or deploy Azure resources, but it can affect the target workload.
- Generated app files are created in the selected subfolder. Removal stops if
  managed files were changed, to avoid deleting user work.
- A new generated app receives the bundled `src/.funcignore` exclusions even
  if a URL installer omits the hidden template file. Deployment refuses a
  missing or incomplete `.funcignore` in the deployment snapshot; restore
  required exclusions in an existing or attached app yourself. The canvas
  does not overwrite its ignore-file edits.

## Product-usage telemetry

Product-usage telemetry is disabled by default. When explicitly configured,
the canvas enqueues only code-defined action, outcome, and panel-control
metadata. Delivery is asynchronous, bounded, memory-only, Entra-authenticated,
and provided by `@microsoft/canvas-toolkit/telemetry`. This canvas supplies the
approved endpoint, audience, token provider, and explicit opt-in policy; the
toolkit does not choose or provision telemetry resources.
Telemetry failures never alter an action result. Prompts,
inputs, outputs, resource IDs, repository names, URLs, paths, commands, raw
errors, tokens, and secrets are excluded.
