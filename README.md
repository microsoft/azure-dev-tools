# Azure Developer Tools

Install Azure-focused GitHub Copilot plugins that help you build Hosted Skills,
inspect Azure resources, diagnose apps with SRE Agent, review cost health,
browse Azure Storage, and create canvas apps.

## Install a plugin

Add the production marketplace once:

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-dev-tools
```

Then install the plugin you need:

```sh
copilot plugin install azure-functions-hosted-skills@azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install azure-resources-query@azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install azure-cost-health-check@azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install azure-sre-agent@azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install azure-storage@azure-dev-tools
copilot plugin install canvas-authoring@azure-dev-tools
```

You can also open GitHub Copilot **Customize > Plugins**, use the marketplace
gear to add `microsoft/azure-dev-tools` (marketplace ID `azure-dev-tools`), and
select a plugin. Fully quit and reopen GitHub Copilot after installation, then
start a fresh chat.

The marketplace follows this repository's default branch. Immutable tags are
the reproducible install points:

| Plugin | What it does | Production status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Azure Functions Hosted Skills](canvases/azure-functions-hosted-skills/) | Build and run local Hosted Skills or invoke supported functions in an existing Function App. | 0.5.5 is tagged; `azure-functions-hosted-skills-latest` points to that release. |
| [Azure Resources Query](canvases/azure-resources-query/) | Find and inspect Azure resources with read-only Resource Graph queries. | 0.1.5 is tagged; `azure-resources-query-latest` points to that release. |
| [Canvas Authoring](plugins/canvas-authoring/) | Add toolkit setup and starter apps to the native `create-canvas` workflow. | 0.1.1 is tagged; `canvas-authoring-latest` points to that release. Skill-only plugin, with no canvas panel. |
| [Azure Cost Health Check](canvases/azure-cost-health-check/) | Review spend, forecasts, budgets, alerts, recommendations, and AI billing. | 0.4.5 is tagged; `azure-cost-health-check-latest` points to that release. |
| [Azure SRE Agent](canvases/azure-sre-agent/) | Connect to your SRE Agent, diagnose failing apps, and investigate incident threads. | 0.4.1 is tagged; `azure-sre-agent-latest` points to that release. |
| [Azure Storage](canvases/azure-storage/) | Browse blobs, inspect statistics, download files, and plan storage transfers with Copilot. | 0.3.0 is tagged; `azure-storage-latest` points to that release. |

Native App marketplace installation has not been verified for every product;
a source package or direct CLI install alone does not establish that the
native listing is live.
